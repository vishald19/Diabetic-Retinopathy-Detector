    <h3><b>What is Diabetic Retinopathy ?</b></h3><br>
    <p><em>Diabetic eye disease, DED !</em></p>
    <p>Diabetic retinopathy, also known as diabetic eye disease (DED), is a medical condition
      in which damage occurs to the retina due to diabetes mellitus. It is a leading cause of blindness
      in developed countries.Retinopathy affects up to 80 percent of those who have had
      diabetes for 20 years or more. At least 90% of new cases could be reduced with proper treatment
      and monitoring of the eyes. The longer a person has diabetes, the higher his or her chances of 
      developing diabetic retinopathy. Each year in the United States, diabetic retinopathy accounts
      for 12% of all new cases of blindness. It is also the leading cause of blindness in people 
      aged 20 to 64.At first, diabetic retinopathy may cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems.
      Eventually, it can cause blindness.The condition can develop in anyone who has type 1 or type 2 
      diabetes.</p>

          <p>Moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy includes the presence of hemorrhages,

             and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities occur less frequently than with severe NPDR.</p>

          <p>Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is the body's attempt to save its retina but it can 
            often lead scarring of the retina and can cause the retina to detach, leading to blindness. 
            Modern eye treatment can help to prevent blindness from occurring as a result of
            proliferative retinopathy.</p>

<!-- Container (The Symptoms Section) -->
<div id="tour" class="container text-center">
  <h3><b>Symptoms</b></h3><br>
  <p><em>Let's have a look!</em></p>
  <p>Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs. Even macular edema, which can cause rapid 
    vision loss, may not have any warning signs for some time. In general, however, a person with 
    macular edema is likely to have blurred vision, making it hard to do things like read or drive. 
    In some cases, the vision will get better or worse during the day.<br><br>The first stage, called 
    non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), has no symptoms. Patients may not notice the signs
    and have 20/20 vision. The only way to detect NPDR is by fundus examination by direct or indirect
    ophthalmoscope by a trained ophthalmologist, fundus photography can be used for objective 
    documentation of the fundus findings, in which microaneurysms (microscopic blood-filled bulges
    in the artery walls) can be seen. If there is reduced vision, fluorescein angiography can show
    narrowing or blocked retinal blood vessels clearly (lack of blood flow or retinal ischemia).<br><br>
    Macular edema, in which blood vessels leak their contents into the macular region, can occur at 
    any stage of NPDR. Its symptoms are blurred vision and darkened or distorted images that are 
    not the same in both eyes. Ten percent (10%) of diabetic patients will have vision loss related 
    to macular edema. Optical Coherence Tomography can show areas of retinal thickening due to fluid
    accumulation from macular edema.In the second stage, abnormal new blood vessels (neovascularisation)
    form at the back of the eye as part of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR); these can burst
    and bleed (vitreous hemorrhage) and blur the vision, because these new blood vessels are fragile.
    The first time this bleeding occurs, it may not be very severe. In most cases, it will leave just
    a few specks of blood, or spots floating in a person's visual field which may last for months.<br><br>
    These spots are often followed within a few days or weeks by a much greater leakage of blood, 
    which blurs the vision. In extreme cases, a person may only be able to tell light from dark in 
    that eye. It may take the blood anywhere from a few days to months or even years to clear from the
    inside of the eye, and in some cases the blood will not clear. These types of large hemorrhages 
    tend to happen more than once.<br><br>On funduscopic exam, a doctor will see cotton wool spots, flame
    hemorrhages, and dot-blot hemorrhages.

<!-- Container (The Risk Factors Section) -->
<div id="contact" class="container text-center">
  <h3><b>Risk Factors </b></h3><br>
  <p>All people with diabetes are at risk – those with Type I diabetes and those with Type 2 diabetes. 
    The longer a person has had diabetes, the higher their risk of developing some ocular problem.
    Between 40 and 45 percent of Americans diagnosed with diabetes have some stage of diabetic 
    retinopathy.After 20 years of diabetes, nearly all patients with Type I diabetes and > 60% of 
    patients with Type II diabetes have some degree of retinopathy; however, these statistics were 
    published in 2002 using data from four years earlier, limiting the usefulness of the research. 
    The subjects would have been diagnosed with diabetes in the late 1970s, before modern fast-acting
    insulin .<br><br>Prior studies had also assumed a clear glycemic threshold
    between people at high and low risk of diabetic retinopathy.Published rates vary between trials, 
    the proposed explanation being differences in study methods and reporting of prevalence rather than
    incidence values.During pregnancy, diabetic retinopathy may also be a problem for women with
    diabetes.
